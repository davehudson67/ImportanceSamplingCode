# Toy Example Code
Code to accompany 'Importance Sampling and Bayesian model comparison in ecology and evolution'

## How to run the analysis

1. Run "SimulateData.R" to simulate and plot some data.
2. Run "ImportanceSampling_H0.R" code which will fit the Null hypothesis and estimate the marginal likelihood.
3. Run "ImportanceSampling_H1.R" code which will fit the Alternative hypothesis and estimate the marginal likelihood.
4. Run "Post_IS_ModelComparisons.R" code which will compare the 2 models run and plot the results.
